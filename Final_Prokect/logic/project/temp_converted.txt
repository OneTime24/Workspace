Technology enhances, rather than replaces, human intelligence.
Technology has become a part in every aspect of our life, from the phones we use, to the applications that help us study. Some people are concerned that technology is making humans dependent and less intelligent. However, this view is not completely true. Technology does not replace human intelligence. It enables us to think better, learn faster, and solve problems more effectively.

One major reason technology enhances human intelligence is that it gives us quick access to
information. People used to have to spend hours searching through books, but today, with one click, we can learn new ideas and understand complex topics. For instance, students use online tutorials to understand complicated topics, such as math or science. This does not make them less smart, it helps them to understand quicker and manage their time efficiently.

Another way that technology improves human intelligence is through increasing our creativity. Modern Tools allow people to design, write, or create things they couldn't do before. For instance, Graphic Designers build their ideas with digital software, and writers enhance their works with the help of editing tools. These tools do not create ideas on their own, they only support the creative thinking that comes from humans.

Some people believe that technology makes humans lazy and less capable of thinking for themselves. They believe it prevents us from thinking for ourselves, relying on devices for answers. While this concern is understandable, it is not entirely correct. Technology is only a tool, it depends on how we use it. If Technology, when used wisely, It encourages critical thinking, such as when students research numerous sources or analyze data to understand a topic.

Therefore, Technology enhances human intelligence through information, supporting creativity. It encourages smarter thinking, and it does not replace our abilities but strengthens them. When put to work, responsibly used, it becomes a partner in learning and problem solving as we grow in ways that were not possible before.
